          <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>The website interaction and class sign ups are very low and at risk of not having enough students to continue the programs.</p>
            <h3>The solution</h3>
            <p>Through research we discovered that parents lack information about STEAM's benefit and the website doesn't answer the needs parents have nor does it excite the parents and students to sign up for STEAM programs. We ended up redesigning the website to answer those needs.</p>

            <li>STEAM knowledge was lacking. 
                Most parents heard of it, but didn't quite know all it stands for, where it can be implemented and why it is beneficial.</li>
            <li>Need for quick information. 
                Parents need to be able to read through the information with ease so they can make a fast decision. Speed/ease is also important when deciding on a program to sign up for.</li>
            <li>Sign up process need to be quick and easy.
                Parents need to be able to sign up for classes quickly and easily otherwise they postpone it for later, risking not completing the registration.</li>

            <h3>Survey</h3>
            <p>The interviews gave us a pretty good indication to what parents need, but we needed to confirm the results of our interviews using quantitative research that will confirm our findings. We conducted a survey with 28 parents who have kids in grades K-12. The survey confirmed some of the information we got through the interviews.</p>

There were a lot of areas that needed to be modified for better UX which we noted for reference. The strongest motif that followed is that the overall look of the website was lacking the visuals to clarify what the website is about and get the parents and their children excited with the programs that they offer.
